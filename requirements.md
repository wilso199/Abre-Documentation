## Basic Requirements

* You will need a working web server \(e.g. Apache\), a database \(e.g. MySQL\) and have PHP configured. We recommend using Ubuntu 14.04 running PHP 5.6.
  * Note: Make sure your PHP installation has Mcrypt installed \(
    [http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php)\). You can install this using the command apt-get install php5-mcrypt
* If you want Abre to send email \(you probably do\) you need a working Sendmail \(Unix/Linux\) on your server or access to an SMTP mail server.
